# Data Cleaning Challenge
This project demonstrates data cleaning techniques using Pandas in Python. It includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and visualizing cleaned data.

## Features:
- Handling Missing Data: Filling and removing NaN values.
- Removing Duplicates: Ensuring unique records.
- Converting Data Types: Formatting date/time and numeric data.
- Revenue Analysis: Calculating total revenue and customer insights.
- Data Visualization: Bar chart for top-selling products.

## Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset:
The dataset was generated for learning purposes. It mimics real-world e-commerce transactions.

## How to Run:

1. *Clone the Repository*:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FrederickEdgarReeceSamuels/Data-Cleaning-Challenge-Analysis-with-Pandas.git

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

Move into the cloned repository (it will have the same name as the repository)
  
 ```bash
   cd Data-Cleaning-Challenge-Analysis-with-Pandas

(If you cloned it into a different location or renamed the folder, adjust the directory name accordingly.)


3. Install Required Packages: Ensure you have Python installed. Install the necessary packages using:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn


4. Open Jupyter Notebook: Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook


5. Run the Notebook: In Jupyter, open Data Cleaning Challenge Analysis with Pandas.ipynb and execute the cells sequentially.
